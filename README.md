### *Pokemon (endpoint)*
> Pokémon are the creatures that inhabit the world of the Pokémon games. They can be caught using Pokéballs and trained by battling with other Pokémon. Each Pokémon belongs to a specific species but may take on a variant which makes it differ from other Pokémon of the same species, such as base stats, available abilities and typings. See [Bulbapedia](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(species)) for greater detail.
